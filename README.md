# GimbalTrim
A small KSP mod that allows the player to manually adjust an engine's gimbal.

Requires [ModuleManager](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/50533-18x-112x-module-manager-422-june-18th-2022-the-heatwave-edition/)

Some notes:

- Pilot input and SAS can't control the engine's gimbal while trim is active.

- Gimbal trim is limited by the engine's gimbal range as given in the engine's config file, but limiting the vectoring range in-game doesn't affect trim, only SAS/pilot input.

- Trim can only be used if the vessel is under full control (i.e. has a pilot onboard or has a connection to KSC).
